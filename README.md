# Capacitor Health Dashboard

This repository contains the frontend web dashboard for our non-invasive condition monitoring project. It provides a real-time, visual interface for tracking the health and degradation of DC link capacitors using telemetry data generated by our hybrid physics-ML edge device.

## The Project Ecosystem
This dashboard is part of a larger, award-winning hardware and machine learning architecture. You can explore the complete system below:

* **[Project Organization Profile](https://github.com/Project-Crescendo)**: The central hub for our team and project overview.
* **[System Architecture & Showcase](https://github.com/Project-Crescendo/capacitor-monitoring-showcase)**: A deep dive into the hardware, DSP (FFT), and XGBoost methodologies powering these metrics.

## Features
* **Real-Time Telemetry:** Subscribes to a public Mosquitto MQTT broker via WebSockets to ingest incoming data with sub-second latency.
* **Dynamic Health Indicators:** A visual LED status dynamically shifts from Healthy (Green) to Warning (Yellow) to Failure (Red) based on live Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) thresholds.
* **Live Trend Graphs:** Utilizes Chart.js to plot moving windows of Capacitance (µF) and ESR (mΩ) over time.
* **Automated Alerting:** Integrated with EmailJS to automatically trigger and send critical warning emails to administrators if the ESR crosses the 190 mΩ safety threshold.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displays live numeric readouts for Capacitance, ESR, Temperature, Machine Learning Health Index (HI), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

## Tech Stack
* **Markup/Styling:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Glassmorphism UI)
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
* **Messaging Protocol:** MQTT.js (WebSockets)
* **Notifications:** EmailJS

## Deployment
This static site is lightweight and currently deployed via Vercel. Because it relies purely on client-side JavaScript for the MQTT WebSocket connection, it requires no backend server configuration to run.
